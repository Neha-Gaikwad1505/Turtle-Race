Turtle Racing Game is a fun and colorful Python mini-game built using the turtle graphics module. In this game, you can select how many racers (from 2 to 10) will compete, and watch as the turtles race toward the finish line. Each turtle moves randomly, making every race unpredictable and exciting!
